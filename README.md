# Description :-

This project was generated using Angular version 18.1.1, with the layout styled using Tailwind CSS. It focuses on creating a responsive design for a Social Links Profile component. I practiced one-way data binding, using string interpolation for the name, person's location and their role, and property binding for the avatar image. I also praticed directives such as 'ngFor' for displaying a set of social media links. I have attached the live website in the description of this repository.
